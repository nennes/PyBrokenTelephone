Let's play broken telephone with Google Translate!! :)

Imagine a queue of people, all speaking different languages. 
Earch can speak only to the person in front of him and listen only the person behind him. And of course, they all use Google Translate!!
Also, the first person is Aristotle! :)

Enjoy the results:
